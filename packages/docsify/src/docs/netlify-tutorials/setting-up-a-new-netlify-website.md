# Setting Up a New Netlify Website

Setting up a new site is as easy as hitting the button in your dashboard that looks like this:

<p style={{"marginLeft":"auto","marginRight":"auto","width":257,"height":133,"maxWidth":"100%"}}><img src="https://smarterlabs.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2F3883ad26-0658-409c-8304-3a0de765f75f%2FScreen_Shot_2021-08-06_at_11.23.18_AM.png?table=block&id=000ef942-95de-4d72-bdd1-1f7afcf55d18&spaceId=2089b25c-d262-479d-a1ff-9c3871a1c564" alt="" /></p>
			

And then click the "Convert Site!" button:

<p style={{"marginLeft":"auto","marginRight":"auto","width":192,"height":134,"maxWidth":"100%"}}><img src="https://smarterlabs.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2Fd5587c56-e723-4051-841b-4c84156e07da%2FScreen_Shot_2021-07-19_at_11.41.14_AM.png?table=block&id=7924d734-4ebd-4bf3-b0fa-c17c7234212d&spaceId=2089b25c-d262-479d-a1ff-9c3871a1c564" alt="" /></p>
			

After that, you'll be directed to Netlify where you will follow the on-screen instructions the rest of the way. It should ask you to connect your GitHub account. After you do that, you should be presented with a screen that lets you name your site, as well as input your site's Webflow URL:

<p style={{"marginLeft":"auto","marginRight":"auto","width":1996,"maxWidth":"100%"}}><img src="https://smarterlabs.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2F49437145-76a6-45df-bbc5-70f0e6596f0d%2FScreen_Shot_2021-07-19_at_11.44.33_AM.png?table=block&id=352f5c09-4aad-405e-a7bf-8d3eeff35a74&spaceId=2089b25c-d262-479d-a1ff-9c3871a1c564" alt="" /></p>
			

Please do not put in the live URL (example: cryolayer.com), just the Webflow URL (example: cryolayer.webflow.io). If you aren't sure what your Webflow URL is, you should be able to find this in the drop-down menu where you go to publish your site:

<p style={{"marginLeft":"auto","marginRight":"auto","width":336,"maxWidth":"100%"}}><img src="https://smarterlabs.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2F97a239bd-f992-4635-ad3f-561ee2b4aa9e%2FScreen_Shot_2021-07-19_at_11.46.09_AM.png?table=block&id=d5edc906-8a56-442b-b833-0fd740b7554e&spaceId=2089b25c-d262-479d-a1ff-9c3871a1c564" alt="" /></p>
			

After you've input the name and URL, just hit the "Save & Deploy" button in Netlify and it will start deploying your site. The time it takes to deploy your site depends on its size. On average, sites take around 2 minutes to deploy.

For more information on Netlify and the deploy process, see the [Netlify documentation](https://docs.netlify.com/).
