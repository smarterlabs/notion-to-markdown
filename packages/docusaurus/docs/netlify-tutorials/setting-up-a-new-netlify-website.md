Setting up a new site is as easy as hitting the button in your dashboard that looks like this:

And then click the "Convert Site!" button:

After that, you'll be directed to Netlify where you will follow the on-screen instructions the rest of the way. It should ask you to connect your GitHub account. After you do that, you should be presented with a screen that lets you name your site, as well as input your site's Webflow URL:

Please do not put in the live URL (example: cryolayer.com), just the Webflow URL (example: cryolayer.webflow.io). If you aren't sure what your Webflow URL is, you should be able to find this in the drop-down menu where you go to publish your site:

After you've input the name and URL, just hit the "Save & Deploy" button in Netlify and it will start deploying your site. The time it takes to deploy your site depends on its size. On average, sites take around 2 minutes to deploy.

For more information on Netlify and the deploy process, see the [Netlify documentation](https://docs.netlify.com/).
