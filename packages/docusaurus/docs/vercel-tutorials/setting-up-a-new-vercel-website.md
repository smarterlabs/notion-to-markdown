Setting up a new site is as easy as hitting the button in your dashboard that looks like this:

And then click the "Convert Site!" button:

After that, you'll be directed to Vercel where you will follow the on-screen instructions the rest of the way. It should ask you to connect your GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket account, as well as input a repository name. The repository name can be whatever you want, we'd recommend the website's name. After you do that, you should be presented with a screen that lets you name your site, as well as input your site's Webflow URL:

![](https://smarterlabs.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2F6f55ce1f-3883-4501-801d-72dce98b3f96%2FScreen_Shot_2021-08-06_at_11.26.49_AM.png?table=block&id=4677b113-18fa-4cfb-a014-94d882c2eb2f&spaceId=2089b25c-d262-479d-a1ff-9c3871a1c564)

Please do not put in the live URL (example: cryolayer.com), just the Webflow URL (example: cryolayer.webflow.io). If you aren't sure what your Webflow URL is, you should be able to find this in the drop-down menu where you go to publish your site:

After you've input the name and URL, just hit the "Deploy" button in Vercel and it will start deploying your site. The time it takes to deploy your site depends on its size. On average, sites take around 2 minutes to deploy.
